Requirements: Method of distortion is easy to produce spontaneously and easy for listener to hear past.

Options:

 1. Interference (noise, degraded recording).
 2. Filler content.
 3. Articulation: changes to the phonetic realization of phonemes.
 4. Acoustics: changes of voice quality affecting acoustics.
 5. Prosody: changes in stress, syllable length.

Compare likeness of two strings:

    difflib.SequenceMatcher(None, s1.lower(), s2.lower()).ratio()

better:

    difflib.SequenceMatcher(None, re.sub(r'[^\w\s]', '', s1.lower()), re.sub(r'[^\w\s]', '', s2.lower()), autojunk=False).ratio()

difflib measures how much of the content of s1 is also found in s2 in the same order as found in s1. Percentage of s2 that is retained from s1 in s1's order. 

WRONG! till better, use the Jaro-Winkler score:

    jellyfish.jaro_winkler(re.sub(r'[^\w\s]', '', s1.lower()), re.sub(r'[^\w\s]', '', s2.lower()))

Another possibility: http://code.google.com/p/google-diff-match-patch/

import difflib, re

def percent_matching(s1, s2):
    #
    # Strip punctuation and lower-case all words
    s1 = re.sub(r'[^\w\s]', '', s1).split()
    s2 = re.sub(r'[^\w\s]', '', s2).split()
    #
    # Get set of all unique words
    all_unique = set(s1)
    all_unique.update(set(s2))
    #
    # Place all unique words in dict {word : item + 32} 
    #     Note that 32 is first printable character, for ease displaying most 
    #     (not necessarily all) of resulting string
    words_as_chars = {word:chr(i + 32) for i, word in enumerate(all_unique)}
    #
    # Convert each list to a string using the value corresp to each list-element
    s1 = ''.join([words_as_chars[w] for w in s1])
    s2 = ''.join([words_as_chars[w] for w in s2])
    #
    # Apply difflib to the two resulting strings. 
    #     Note: uses Ratcliff/Obershelp pattern recognition
    #     (see http://www.nist.gov/dads/HTML/ratcliffObershelp.html)
    return round(
            difflib.SequenceMatcher(None, s1, s2, autojunk=False).ratio(), 1)


#
# Not using edit distance because:
#   1. not all allowable transformations (such as transposition) are valid for our purposes;
#   2. converting a number of edits to a percentage does not measure the same thing as difflib.SequenceMatcher
# No transpositions; insertion and deletion only — a substitution is 1 as edit distance but two events here
#
# Not using phonetic values since, if the transcriber fails through wrong 
# assumptions about the phonetics of standard words, our use of those same 
# assumptions would repeat the error.
