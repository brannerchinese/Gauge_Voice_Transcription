Interfering with Voice-Recognition Software

Normally we want to improve the quality of voice-recognition, for instance in the use of tools for the hearing-impaired, automated stenography, or giving verbal instructions to a robotic servant.

Today I wonder to consider the reverse question: What means do I have to confound automatic voice recognition and transcription?

Limit myself to procedures that are laborious neither to execute nor to understand, and limit myself to standard English.

Must be usable on the fly, without preparation. No codes, ciphers, steganography, or heavy use of filler words (wink wink, nudge nudge). 

Also no resorting foreign language or non-standard accents (in spite of their considerable utility).

I used Google's automated transcription of voicemail for this project.

Evaluation: Google provides its transcription along with a confidence value for each word, which can be combined into a single confidence value for the whole transcription. I wrote a piece of code to compare how much alike the transcription Google provides is to the original text.

Google supplies a transcription composed of well-formed English words, so there is question of typographical errors, for which edit distance would be a useful quantification tool. 

Instead, given an original string `s1` and a transcription string `s2`, I look for the longest common substring of `s1` in `s2` with whatever
